/**
 * Calinski-Harabasz implementation of {@link InternalClusterValidator}.
 * <p>
 * The formula for calculating this index can be found on page 453 from
 * the book given in the document for Phase 4:
 * <blockquote>
 * "The Calinskiâ€“Harabasz (CH) variance ratio criterion for a given
 * value of {@code k} is defined as follows:
 * <pre>
 * {@code CH = ((n - k) / (k - 1)) * ((tr(Sb) / (tr(Sw))}
 * </pre>
 * where {@code tr(Sw)} and {@code tr(Sb)} are the trace of {@code S}
 * (the sum of the diagonal elements) of the within cluster and between
 * cluster scatter matrices."
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * We know that {@code tr(Sw)} is the intra-dispersion of the clusters.
 * Furthermore, the document for Phase 4 states:
 * <blockquote>
 * "The trace of the within-clusters scatter matrix, {@code tr(Sw)},
 * is the same as SSE, which is already calculated by k-means. Therefore,
 * you do not need to calculate {@code tr(Sw)} separately."
 * </blockquote>
 * <p>
 * This means we can simply use {@link PointClusters#getSumOfSquaredErrors()}
 * in order to calculate the intra-dispersion. However, {@code tr(Sw)} still
 * needs to be calculated.
 * <p>
 * According to the website <a href="https://pyshark.com/calinski-harabasz-index-for-k-means-clustering-evaluation-using-python/#calculate-calinski-harabasz-index">
 * PyShark</a>, {@code tr(Sb)} (or "between group SSE" as the site calls it)
 * can be found by calculating the sum of multiplying the number of points
 * in a cluster by the squared error of its centroid and the barycenter of
 * a dataset.
