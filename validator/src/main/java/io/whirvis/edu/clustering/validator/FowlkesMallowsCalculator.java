/**
 * Fowlkes-Mallows implementation of {@link ExternalClusterValidator}.
 * <p>
 * Calculation of the Fowlkes-Mallows measure (FM) relies on the calculation
 * of the "truth table" between a ground truth (the clusters which each
 * data point actually belongs to) and a generated cluster. The specifics
 * of the truth table itself are laid out in {@link ClusterTruthTable}.
 * <p>
 * Once the truth table is obtained, calculating the Fowlkes-Mallows measure
 * is quite straight forward. From page 437 of the Data Mining book given in
 * the document for Phase 5:
 * <blockquote>
 * "The Fowlkesâ€“Mallows (FM) measure is defined as the geometric mean of
 * the pairwise precision and recall."
 * </blockquote>
 * In this case, the "pairwise precision" and "recall" are defined as:
 * <pre>
 * precision = TP / (TP + FP)
 * recall = TP / (TP + FN)
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This makes the formula for the Fowlkes-Mallows measure:
 * <pre>
 * FM = sqrt(precision * recall) = TP / sqrt((TP + FN) * (TP + FP))
 * </pre>
 * Where {@code TP} is the number true positives, {@code FN} is the number
 * of false negatives, and {@code FP} is the number of false positives.
